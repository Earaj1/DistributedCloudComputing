# 03 - Distributed Processing

## Lecture overview
In this lecture, we look at **distributed processing** (threads, virtualisation), inter-process communication and remote invocation of code and data for distributed systems and techniques for communication between elements of a distributed system. 

We also consider how that communication is underpinned theoretically through different approaches and how distributed systems are supported by operating systems.

Next we look at [**distributed processing**](/workspaces/DistributedCloudComputing/04-distributed-processing/README.md) (threads, virtualisation), inter-process communication and remote invocation of code and data for distributed systems and techniques for communication between elements of a distributed system. We also consider how that communication is underpinned theoretically through different approaches and how distributed systems are supported by operating systems.
